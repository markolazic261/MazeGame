# No requirements!
Just work on developing your **features** and meeting **milestones**. Experiment with **branching** and **pull requests** to test your ideas. Remember to use the issue tracker to keep track of the **bugs**.

Having a good trail of commit messages and issue tracker usage will be reviewed later in the project, so make sure you use it as much as you can throughout the project.
