# Requirements
In the first week you should:
* Find a partner
* Decide on a topic
* Present topic at övning
* Create a single repo on KTH Github and share with partner
* Write a short Project Description, using the repo's README
* Decide and map out the Project Plan using Features/Milestones via Issue Tracker
* Start developing!

# Notes
All team members should attend övning and present together.
If you need help creating a repo, consult online documentation first, then consult your assistant.

The **Project Description** should contain:
1. A short, clear description of the project
2. Documentation on how to install and use the project (this will evolve)
3. Give a description of your testing strategy

The **Project Plan** should be expressed using Features/Milestones that are:
1. Clear units of achievable work described as **Features** in the Issue Tracker
2. Sensible groups of features/bugs into **Milestones** (by time, e.g. "Week 1", or by function, e.g. "Backend", or a schema you prefer)
3. Discussed and updated and closed as the project evolves
